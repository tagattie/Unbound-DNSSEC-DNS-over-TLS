# Forward zones
# Create entries like below, to make all queries for 'example.com' and
# 'example.org' go to the given list of servers. These servers have to handle
# recursion to other nameservers. List zero or more nameservers by hostname
# or by ipaddress. Use an entry with name "." to forward all queries.
# If you enable forward-first, it attempts without the forward if it fails.
# forward-zone:
#	name: "example.com"
#	forward-addr: 192.0.2.68
#	forward-addr: 192.0.2.73@5355  # forward to port 5355.

#	forward-tls-upstream: no
# forward-zone:
